### Assignment 1:Two-Level Logic Optimization

1. Introduction:
    Implement a two-level logic optimization program to reduce the literal count of given Boolean equations in SOP form. Use the Quine-McClusky approach learned in class and consider incorporating heuristic methods. While minimizing literal count is a primary focus, the runtime efficiency of the program is also crucial.

2. Problem Description:
   Reduce literal count in given Boolean equations.

3. Method:
    Quine-McClusky and Petrick's method

### Assignment 2:Partitioning

1. Introduction:
    After technology mapping, the physical design involves implementing the design on the die, considering various factors. Partitioning, a crucial step, groups cells to handle large designs efficiently. This "shrinking procedure" results in smaller groups, optimizing placement.

2. Problem Description:
   minimize the cost function of cutsize without violating area constraint

3. Method:
    FM algorithm
